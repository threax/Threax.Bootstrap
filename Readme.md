# threax.bootstrap
This theme is used in the threax open source applications. It uses the Darkly theme and will build itself with its artifacts.json.

## Customizing
This theme can be used as a starting point. Its very easy to incorporate a [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) theme. Find the one you
want to use on the site, download the `_variables.scss` and `_bootswatch.scss` files and rename them to remove the _ and include them
in a clone of this repo. When you build your app the theme will be applied.
